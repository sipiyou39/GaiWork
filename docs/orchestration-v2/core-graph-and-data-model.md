# Core Graph And Data Model

## Overview

V2 models orchestration as a graph with a small number of durable entity types:

```text
Project
  AppThread
    Run
      ExecutionNode tree
    ProviderThread handles
    Context handoffs
    Checkpoints
```

The central separation is:

- `AppThread`: the user-visible conversation in T3 Code.
- `Run`: a counted user-visible turn on an app thread.
- `ExecutionNode`: a unit of provider/runtime work inside a run.
- `ProviderThread`: a provider-native conversation handle.
- `ProviderSession`: a live or resumable provider process/runtime.
- `ContextHandoff`: a provider-switch summary that bridges runs into another provider thread.

Provider-specific lifecycle is preserved in provider refs and raw events. App behavior is driven by app-owned ids and graph relationships.

## AppThread

An `AppThread` is the stable user-facing conversation. It owns messages, runs, checkpoints, and UI state. It does not have to map one-to-one with a provider-native thread forever.

```ts
type AppThread = {
  id: ThreadId;
  projectId: ProjectId;
  title: string;
  defaultProvider: ProviderKind;
  modelSelection: ModelSelection;
  runtimeMode: RuntimeMode;
  interactionMode: InteractionMode;
  branch: string | null;
  worktreePath: string | null;
  activeProviderThreadId: ProviderThreadId | null;
  forkedFrom: ForkSource | null;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  archivedAt: string | null;
  deletedAt: string | null;
};
```

`activeProviderThreadId` points to the provider-native conversation currently backing the app thread. Forking, provider migration, or recovery may create new provider threads while preserving the same app thread, depending on the operation.

`defaultProvider` is only the currently selected default for future runs. Historical runs retain their own provider and provider thread bindings.

## Run

A `Run` is the counted user-visible turn. This replaces using provider turn ids as the app-level lifecycle boundary.

```ts
type Run = {
  id: RunId;
  threadId: ThreadId;
  ordinal: number;
  provider: ProviderKind;
  providerThreadId: ProviderThreadId | null;
  userMessageId: MessageId;
  rootNodeId: NodeId | null;
  activeAttemptId: RunAttemptId | null;
  status:
    | "queued"
    | "starting"
    | "running"
    | "waiting"
    | "completed"
    | "interrupted"
    | "failed"
    | "cancelled"
    | "rolled_back";
  requestedAt: string;
  startedAt: string | null;
  completedAt: string | null;
  checkpointId: CheckpointId | null;
  contextHandoffId: ContextHandoffId | null;
  sourcePlanRef?: {
    threadId: ThreadId;
    planId: ProposedPlanId;
  };
};
```

Only a run with `countsForConversation = true` contributes to the user-visible turn count and checkpoint count.

`providerThreadId` is the provider-native conversation used for this run. This makes mixed-provider app threads explicit: run 1 may be Codex, run 2 may be Claude, and run 3 may return to the original Codex provider thread.

## RunAttempt

A `RunAttempt` represents one provider execution attempt for an app run. Most runs have exactly one attempt. Steering, retries, provider recovery, or provider-switch recovery may create more than one attempt.

```ts
type RunAttempt = {
  id: RunAttemptId;
  runId: RunId;
  attemptOrdinal: number;
  rootNodeId: NodeId;
  provider: ProviderKind;
  providerThreadId: ProviderThreadId;
  providerTurnId: ProviderTurnId | null;
  reason: "initial" | "steering_restart" | "retry" | "provider_recovery";
  status:
    | "pending"
    | "running"
    | "completed"
    | "interrupted"
    | "failed"
    | "cancelled"
    | "superseded";
  startedAt: string | null;
  completedAt: string | null;
};
```

Run attempts let app-level steering work even for providers that cannot steer an active native turn. The app can interrupt the active provider turn and create a replacement attempt under the same `RunId`.

Only one attempt is the final selected attempt for run completion and checkpointing. Superseded/interrupted attempts remain in the execution graph for audit/debugging.

## ExecutionNode

An `ExecutionNode` is the generic unit of runtime work. It is the bridge between provider events and app behavior.

```ts
type ExecutionNode = {
  id: NodeId;
  threadId: ThreadId;
  runId: RunId | null;
  parentNodeId: NodeId | null;
  rootNodeId: NodeId;
  kind:
    | "root_turn"
    | "assistant_message"
    | "reasoning"
    | "plan"
    | "todo_list"
    | "tool_call"
    | "approval_request"
    | "user_input_request"
    | "subagent"
    | "hook"
    | "system";
  status:
    | "pending"
    | "running"
    | "waiting"
    | "completed"
    | "interrupted"
    | "failed"
    | "cancelled"
    | "rolled_back";
  countsForRun: boolean;
  providerThreadId: ProviderThreadId | null;
  providerTurnId: ProviderTurnId | null;
  runtimeItemId: RuntimeItemId | null;
  runtimeRequestId: RuntimeRequestId | null;
  checkpointScopeId: CheckpointScopeId | null;
  startedAt: string | null;
  completedAt: string | null;
};
```

The root node of a run is the only node allowed to complete the run. Subagent nodes, tool nodes, approval nodes, and plan nodes may complete independently.

## CheckpointScope

A `CheckpointScope` describes a unit of filesystem state that can be checkpointed. Root runs and child execution nodes can both have checkpoint scopes.

```ts
type CheckpointScope = {
  id: CheckpointScopeId;
  threadId: ThreadId;
  runId: RunId | null;
  nodeId: NodeId;
  parentScopeId: CheckpointScopeId | null;
  providerThreadId: ProviderThreadId | null;
  kind: "root_run" | "subagent" | "tool" | "provider_thread" | "manual";
  ordinalWithinParent: number;
  advancesAppRunCount: boolean;
  cwd: string;
  createdAt: string;
};
```

Root run scopes have `advancesAppRunCount = true`. Child scopes, such as subagents, have `advancesAppRunCount = false` and are nested under the parent run's scope.

## ProviderSession

A `ProviderSession` is a live provider runtime process/session, such as a Codex app-server process or a Claude SDK session.

```ts
type ProviderSession = {
  id: ProviderSessionId;
  provider: ProviderKind;
  status: "starting" | "ready" | "running" | "waiting" | "stopped" | "error";
  cwd: string;
  model: string | null;
  capabilities: ProviderCapabilities;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  lastError: string | null;
};
```

A provider session may host one or more provider threads if the provider supports it. If a provider only supports one active conversation per process, V2 still models that as one provider thread attached to the session.

## ProviderThread

A `ProviderThread` is a provider-native conversation handle. It is addressable even when it is nested under a subagent execution node.

```ts
type ProviderThread = {
  id: ProviderThreadId;
  provider: ProviderKind;
  providerSessionId: ProviderSessionId | null;
  appThreadId: ThreadId | null;
  ownerNodeId: NodeId | null;
  nativeThreadRef: string | null;
  status: "not_loaded" | "idle" | "active" | "archived" | "closed" | "error";
  firstRunOrdinal: number | null;
  lastRunOrdinal: number | null;
  handoffIds: ContextHandoffId[];
  forkedFrom: ProviderThreadForkSource | null;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
};
```

`appThreadId` is set when the provider thread backs a first-class app thread. `ownerNodeId` is set when the provider thread is nested under an execution node, such as a subagent. A provider thread can later be forked or promoted into a first-class app thread.

A provider thread may have gaps in its native run coverage. Example: runs 1-5 use Codex provider thread A, runs 6-8 use Claude provider thread B, and run 9 returns to Codex thread A with a handoff summary covering runs 6-8. In that case, Codex thread A remains the same provider thread, but it has an explicit `ContextHandoff` before run 9.

## ContextHandoff

A `ContextHandoff` is a first-class artifact created when provider context must be bridged. It is most common when changing providers between runs, but it also applies when provider resume fails and a replacement provider thread must be seeded from app history.

```ts
type ContextHandoff = {
  id: ContextHandoffId;
  threadId: ThreadId;
  targetRunId: RunId;
  fromProviderThreadIds: ProviderThreadId[];
  toProviderThreadId: ProviderThreadId;
  coveredRunOrdinals: {
    from: number;
    to: number;
  };
  strategy:
    | "delta_since_target_last_seen"
    | "full_thread_summary"
    | "checkpoint_summary"
    | "manual_context";
  status: "pending" | "ready" | "failed" | "superseded";
  summaryMessageId: MessageId | null;
  summaryText: string;
  createdByProvider: ProviderKind | null;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
};
```

The handoff is not just prompt text. It is part of the graph and can be inspected, regenerated, superseded, or audited.

The preferred return-to-provider strategy is `delta_since_target_last_seen`: resume the previous provider thread and summarize only the runs that happened while that provider was inactive. Use `full_thread_summary` when resume fails, provider settings are incompatible, or the accumulated handoffs would create poor context quality.

## ProviderTurn

A `ProviderTurn` is the normalized handle for a provider-native turn.

```ts
type ProviderTurn = {
  id: ProviderTurnId;
  providerThreadId: ProviderThreadId;
  nodeId: NodeId;
  runAttemptId: RunAttemptId | null;
  nativeTurnRef: string | null;
  ordinal: number;
  status: "pending" | "running" | "completed" | "interrupted" | "failed" | "cancelled";
  startedAt: string | null;
  completedAt: string | null;
};
```

Codex has strong native turn ids. Weaker providers may only have ordinals. Both map into `ProviderTurnId`.

## RuntimeItem

Items are provider-visible work units inside a turn or node.

```ts
type RuntimeItem = {
  id: RuntimeItemId;
  nodeId: NodeId;
  providerTurnId: ProviderTurnId | null;
  nativeItemRef: string | null;
  ordinal: number;
  kind:
    | "assistant_message"
    | "reasoning"
    | "plan"
    | "todo_list"
    | "command_execution"
    | "file_change"
    | "mcp_tool_call"
    | "dynamic_tool_call"
    | "collab_agent_tool_call"
    | "web_search"
    | "unknown";
  status: "pending" | "running" | "completed" | "failed" | "cancelled";
  title: string | null;
  detail: string | null;
};
```

The item id is app-owned. Provider-native item ids are refs.

## RuntimeRequest

Requests represent provider-originated callbacks that require app/user response.

```ts
type RuntimeRequest = {
  id: RuntimeRequestId;
  nodeId: NodeId;
  providerTurnId: ProviderTurnId | null;
  runtimeItemId: RuntimeItemId | null;
  nativeRequestRef: string | null;
  kind:
    | "command_approval"
    | "file_read_approval"
    | "file_change_approval"
    | "dynamic_tool_call"
    | "user_input"
    | "auth_refresh";
  status: "pending" | "resolved" | "expired" | "cancelled";
  responseCapability:
    | { type: "live"; providerSessionId: ProviderSessionId }
    | { type: "not_resumable"; reason: string };
  createdAt: string;
  resolvedAt: string | null;
};
```

Requests may remain visible after restart, but they are only respondable if their `responseCapability` is live.

## Messages

Messages are part of the conversation projection, not the raw provider graph. They link back to runs and nodes when possible.

```ts
type ConversationMessage = {
  id: MessageId;
  threadId: ThreadId;
  runId: RunId | null;
  nodeId: NodeId | null;
  role: "user" | "assistant" | "system";
  text: string;
  attachments: Attachment[];
  streaming: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
};
```

Provider message chunks are collected through items/content events and projected into messages. The projection may hide child/subagent messages by default while preserving them in the graph.

## Plans, Questions, And Todo Lists

V2 treats these as structured runtime items or nodes.

```ts
type PlanArtifact = {
  id: PlanId;
  threadId: ThreadId;
  runId: RunId | null;
  nodeId: NodeId;
  kind: "proposed_plan" | "todo_list" | "questions";
  status: "draft" | "active" | "completed" | "superseded";
  markdown?: string;
  steps?: Array<{ id: string; text: string; status: "pending" | "running" | "completed" }>;
  questions?: UserInputQuestion[];
};
```

Codex `turn/plan/updated` maps to a `todo_list` artifact. Plan-mode final plan items map to `proposed_plan`. User-input question requests map to `questions` plus a `RuntimeRequest`.

## Checkpoint

Checkpoints attach to checkpoint scopes. A root run checkpoint is the user-visible conversation checkpoint. A child checkpoint records nested filesystem state for a subagent, tool, or provider thread without advancing the parent run count.

```ts
type Checkpoint = {
  id: CheckpointId;
  threadId: ThreadId;
  scopeId: CheckpointScopeId;
  runId: RunId | null;
  nodeId: NodeId;
  parentCheckpointId: CheckpointId | null;
  ordinalWithinScope: number;
  appRunOrdinal: number | null;
  ref: string;
  status: "ready" | "missing" | "error";
  files: CheckpointFileSummary[];
  capturedAt: string;
};
```

A child/subagent provider turn can create a child checkpoint. It does not create an app-run checkpoint unless it is running as a first-class app run in a forked/promoted thread.

## Raw Event Log

The raw event log is append-only evidence.

```ts
type RawProviderEvent = {
  id: RawEventId;
  provider: ProviderKind;
  providerSessionId: ProviderSessionId;
  sequence: number;
  direction: "incoming" | "outgoing";
  messageKind: "request" | "response" | "notification" | "error";
  method: string | null;
  jsonRpcId: string | number | null;
  payload: unknown;
  observedAt: string;
};
```

No domain behavior should depend on parsing historic UI events if raw provider events are available.

## Projections

V2 should expose separate projections:

- Thread shell: fast sidebar list.
- Thread detail: messages, runs, activities, checkpoints, plans.
- Execution graph: debug/developer view of nodes and provider refs.
- Provider sessions: live runtime/process state.
- Pending requests: actionable approvals/user input.

The UI can remain simple while the graph remains precise.
